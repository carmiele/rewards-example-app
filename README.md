# Rewards Example App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is an example React application demonstrating a rewards program by a retailer, with sample data of customer transactions over the last 3 months provided in `sample-data.js`.

Requirements:
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.

This application shows: 
- the reward points earned for each customer per month and total (in 3 months). 
- the amount spent in each month and total (in 3 months)
